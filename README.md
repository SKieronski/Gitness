# Gitness
Gitness is a full-stack app that allows users to view and share workout routines. They can also see specific details about each exercise, such as: description, reps/sets, and a gif example of the exercise! There is also full CRUD functionality through our custom API. Our app aims to be readable and usable, and also be a one-stop shop for users to host their routines and never have to cross-reference with other sites again!
