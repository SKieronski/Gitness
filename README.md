## MVP User Stores

* As a user, I want to see a list of all the routines so that I can pick one that sounds interesting to me.
* As a user, I would like to select a specific routine to find out more about it.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate the webpage on desktop and on phones.
* As a user, I want to be able to create and add my own workout routine.

## Post MVP Stretch Goals
* As a user, I would like to be able to see a demo of the exercise.
* As a user, I would like to see meal plan options associated with each workout.
* As a user, I would like to login so that I can save routines to my account and view them without browsing through the entire routine collection.
* As a user, I would like to search for routines based on a specific query. (Legs, Arms, Bodyweight, Lifts).
